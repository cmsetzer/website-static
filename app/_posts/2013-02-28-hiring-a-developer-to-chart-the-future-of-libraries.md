The Harvard Library Innovation Lab is looking for a highly creative and motivated developer to dream up and develop innovative projects that chart the future of libraries.

We are a tightly knit team of six and are passionate about solving problems, having fun, and improving lives through libraries.  Join us!

**This is definitely a dream job for somebody out there.**

The best way to get a feel for what we do is by looking at [our projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/our-work/).

**A sample of our work**

[Awesome Box](http://awesomebox.io) is current project in the Lab

[Library Test Kitchen](http://librarytestkitchen.org) is a course we run in the Fall, in it we launched LABRARY, a Pop-Up Library Experiment

**What you'll do**

* Work on a range of software projects, from large to small, that can bring immediate benefit or prototype the future.

* Make stuff with modern web technologies.  Some will be larger LiL projects, others are your own.

* Work alone with a good bit of freedom, which means a great deal of initiative is required.

* Work collaboratively on long-term and short-term projects.

* Rely on your good design sense and user-centricity.

**Two possible misnomers**

* While we are part of the Harvard Law School Library, which is awesome, our mission and work applies to the entire Harvard Library and academic and public library worlds.

* Our vision of the library is a flexible and ever-changing one.

We are open to a wide range of skills, from a front-end _"wow the user in the browser"_ nerd, to a back-end _"organize the world"_ geek. If you build cool things and can show us products that you've shipped, we want to talk to you.
