AI is poised to fundamentally change journalism—its practice, its economics, and its import. In a world where media is so easily generated, how can the relationship between AI and journalism be structured to reaffirm our ability to establish, value, and communicate truth?

To answer this question, the Library Innovation Lab at Harvard is hosting Transform: Journalism, a one-day gathering of key decision-makers and stakeholders from model-makers and journalism agencies to academia and news publications. This private workshop aims to identify a set of shared values and collaborative opportunities that might guide the evolution of AI and journalism toward the sustainable cultivation of truth. <!--more--> Over the course of a day, these thoughtful people will map the landscape, discuss control mechanisms and their trade-offs, and synthesize the ideas that emerge into practicable proposals for adoption.

This event is part of the Library Innovation Lab’s Transform Series, where we convene unique groups of stakeholders across disciplines to transform the future of open knowledge.

This event will be held under the Chatham House Rule, meaning that participants will be free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.
