Thinking about legal tech, civic tech, or cultural memory? We have options.

**Research Assistants:** We're seeking paid research assistants with a web
development background to help us build open source legal
tech and civic tech tools like <a href="/our-work/perma-cc" class="interactive-link dark reverse">Perma.cc</a>, <a href="/our-work/h2o/opencasebook.org" class="interactive-link dark reverse">opencasebook.org</a>,
and <a href="/our-work/caselaw-access-project" class="interactive-link dark reverse">Case.law</a>.


**Student Fellows:** We offer student fellow positions to provide mentorship to
students working on independent projects in the field of
open knowledge (legal tech, civic tech, library tech,
online governance, etc.). Depending on subject matter and
professor relationships, student fellow positions may or
may not offer stipend or credit; please reach out to us to
discuss.

**Eligibility:** Positions are open to students inside and outside Harvard,
with a preference for students at Harvard Law School and
Harvard University.
