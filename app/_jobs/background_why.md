**Job stability and support.** While we maintain the creative atmosphere and flexibility of a small innovation lab, we're backed by an established institution with strong benefits and support for employees.

**Room to pursue your research agenda.** We are located at the Harvard Law School Library and share a kitchen with  the Berkman Klein Center and metaLAB. Going to events, having conversations, developing your scholarly perspective, and exploring it through creative projects are encouraged. We will specifically prioritize these things at the cost of shipping the next feature.

**Set your own pace.** We are a small, self-directed group that depends on internal motivation rather than externally imposed crunch time.

**Build open source.** All of our projects are open source and otherwise designed to maximize the public benefit of our work.

**Work on stuff that matters.** The projects we make are measured by how they help people in the long term.
