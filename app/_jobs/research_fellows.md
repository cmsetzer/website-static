The Library Innovation Lab offers a small number of
stipended fellowships to people developing tools and
communities to explore the future of open knowledge.

**Who should apply:** Fellowships are a particularly good fit for people&mdash;
inside and outside academia!&mdash;with a track record of
building tools or leading communities that advance the
conversation about cultural knowledge and the internet,
and who need financial and institutional support to take
their next steps.

By "cultural knowledge and the internet," we mean
questions like: how do established cultural memory
institutions adapt to the internet age and help societies
reconstruct and remember their history? How do societies
govern themselves, coordinate solutions to problems, and
decide who to trust in the evolving information landscape?
How do we preserve today's knowledge for future
generations?

In short, who are we, how did we get here, and where are
we going? And who is "we" in a networked world anyway?

**Fellowship details:** Fellowships are individually arranged on a rolling basis,
and may be any length from a week to a year. Fellows are
expected to visit Harvard in person for a portion of the
appointment, but need not be present full time. Stipends
are available to support full-time work, but may be
prorated depending on time commitment and other sources of
support.
