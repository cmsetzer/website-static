The work and well-being of the Lab are strengthened profoundly by the
diversity of our community and our differences in background, culture,
experience, racial identity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, and much
more. We actively seek and welcome applications from Black and Indigenous people and people of color;
women and non-binary people; the LGBTQ+ community; and people with disabilities; as well as
applications from researchers and practitioners from across the
spectrum of disciplines, methods, and life experiences.
