The Library Innovation Lab is a unit of the Harvard Law School Library and shares space with the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society.

We are based in a newly-renovated space on the Harvard Law School campus. Our full-time staff positions are hybrid/in-person; we typically aim to be in the office Tuesday through Thursday. Contractor and fellowship positions may be remote by individual arrangement.
