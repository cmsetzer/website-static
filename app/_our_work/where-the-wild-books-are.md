title: Where the Wild Books Are

project_website: https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab/projects/where-wild-books-are
github_repo: https://github.com/harvard-lil/wtwba-app

what_does_it_do: >
  An exploration of how students engage with the library collection, inside and outside the library building.

why_does_it_exist: >
  Most libraries have limited empirical data describing how the community
  engages with resources, but Where the Wild Books Are sought to increase
  that knowledge by conducting a study in which students track their
  library engagement using a mobile application. Using an app on their own
  mobile devices, students simply scan the barcode of an item and the app s
  tores the timestamp and geolocation data for analysis.
