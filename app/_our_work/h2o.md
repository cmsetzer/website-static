what_does_it_do: >
  H2O is a platform for creating, sharing, and remixing open course materials.

# Optional
why_does_it_exist: |
  Traditional textbooks, especially legal casebooks, are heavy, expensive and inflexible. Students will spend several thousand dollars on casebooks by the time they graduate even though the bulk of the content - the cases - are in the public domain and should be freely accessible. Legal education is also changing quickly, and commercial, hardbound casebooks canâ€™t keep up. H2O allows instructors to find open casebooks they can use or adapt, or create their own from scratch.
