what_does_it_do: >
  A collaborative digital community bulletin board.

why_does_it_exist: >
  It turns the traditional and ephemeral community bulletin board into
  a digital resource with photos of events and activities, submitted to
  the application using mobile phones. It provides a slick and simple
  platform to display a collaboratively-submitted, media-focused digital
  calendar, ultimately serving as an archive of the information.
