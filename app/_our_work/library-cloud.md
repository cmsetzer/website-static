title: Library Cloud

project_website: https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab/projects/library-cloud

what_does_it_do: >
  LibraryCloud is infrastructure for sharing what libraries know.

why_does_it_exist: >
  It is a prototype metadata hub and data service that provides open, programmatic
  access to the metadata available within the Harvard Library ecosystem.
  It normalizes metadata so that it can be found across silos, and enriches it
  with connections to information within the Libraryâ€™s collection and beyond.
  Benefits of such a metadata server include an open platform for developers
  to create related tools and applications, provision of data for research purposes,
  and lower barriers to creating services for specialized research and teaching communities.
