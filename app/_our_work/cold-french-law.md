title: "COLD French Law"
---

Part of the Collaborative Open Legal Data collection, the COLD French Law dataset contains over 800,000 articles extracted from the LEGI dataset, one of France’s official open law repositories, that were programmatically identified as “currently applicable French law” by our pipeline.

This dataset—formatted into a single CSV file and openly available on Hugging Face—contains original texts from the LEGI dataset as well as machine-generated French to English translations thanks to the participation of the CoCounsel team at Casetext, part of Thomson Reuters.

COLD French Law was initially compiled to be used in a forthcoming experiment at the Lab. We also released it broadly as part of our commitment to open knowledge. We see this dataset as a contribution to the quickly expanding field of legal AI, and hope it will help researchers, builders, and tinkerers of all kinds in their endeavors.
