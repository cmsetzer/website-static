title: Library License

project_website: https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab/projects/library-license

what_does_it_do: >
  Library License is an experimental initiative designed to keep books available to readers even after they have ceased to be commercially viable.

why_does_it_exist:
  Using [Library License](https://web.archive.org/web/20140517195059/http://librarylicense.org/), an author can negotiate a contractual rider with a publisher that gives books a second life. Once a Library License comes into effect, a digital copy of the book is made available to participating libraries. The project envisions a secure, rights-managed distribution system and a mechanism for triggering legal access when a Library License comes into effect.
