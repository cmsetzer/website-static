what_does_it_do: >
  The Nuremberg Project is digitizing our collection of materials from the Nuremberg trials.

# Optional
why_does_it_exist: |
  The Harvard Law School Library has roughly one million pages of documents relating to the trials of military and political leaders and other war criminals from Nazi Germany. The documents include trial transcripts, court filings, evidence files and other papers, all of which are of profound historical and scholarly value. To preserve these materials and expand access to them, LIL is leading the effort to digitize the paper files and to organize and enrich them with metadata to facilitate online access.
