                <p>
                    On the north side of downtown San Jose, tucked against a gentle curve in California State Route 87
                    and the Guadalupe River that it follows, sits a nondescript single-story off-white building with
                    tinted windows. As of the time of writing this, signs exclaim that 99 Notre Dame Avenue is available
                    for lease. The two adjacent lots are also empty and being used as parking lots, mostly as overflow
                    for the municipal courthouse a few blocks away. Across the street the condos start, glassy and
                    standardized, one pale red and cream and the next a mixture of aqua and silver, stretching to the
                    sky for blocks east toward City Hall and south until you hit the looming corporate headquarters of
                    Adobe Inc. The low building’s only active neighbor is a weightlifting and martial arts gym in the
                    adjoining warehouse that gives no hint of what used to be built there. Otherwise it sits alone.

                <p>
                    In the 1950s, 99 Notre Dame Avenue housed IBM’s first West Coast laboratory. Back then it overlooked
                    a plum orchard. Between 1952 and 1956, a team of engineers led by a former high school science
                    teacher designed and built the IBM 350 disk storage unit, part of the IBM 305 RAMAC, the first
                    computer system that included something resembling a hard drive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before RAMAC, to store and access computer data was a laborious process involving feeding stacks of
                    punch cards through machines. Other early solutions, like storing data on magnetic tape, were
                    effective but slow. The IBM team created spinning aluminum disks readable by a magnetic arm which
                    allowed data to be retrieved in a literal blink. The 24-inch platters were stacked 50 at a time in a
                    cylinder. They rotated at close to 1200 rpm. Even in the 1950s, with the room-sized console only
                    capable of storing 3.75 megabytes and weighing over a ton, this machine could retrieve data in 800
                    milliseconds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The revolutionary element of the hard disk drive was not that it stored data for computers—there
                    were plenty of other methods for that—but that you could store data that could then be accessed
                    almost instantly. Your storage could be constantly connected to your system, an integral component,
                    representing a tremendous shift in both the technical and conceptual idea of what a computer could
                    even be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    RAMAC is the ancestor of every hard drive, every server, every relational database, every cloud. 99
                    Notre Dame Avenue is its birthplace. For digital storage, this is the Trinity Test Site, the
                    explosive center from which all else follows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    RAMAC’s massive aluminum disks were coated in iron oxide, with little magnetic slots for data, bits
                    to be read as they spun. Originally marketed narrowly toward accountants, IBM built and leased
                    around 1,000 RAMAC 305 systems to businesses that used punch card systems. But within six years, the
                    IBM 350 storage unit was completely obsolete, replaced by new model numbers and new designs. The
                    returned units were scrapped, one by one. The march to create something smaller, faster, denser, and
                    cheaper forced them off the market in less than a decade.

                    Only three RAMAC 305 systems and seven individual 350 disk drives in various configurations are
                    known to have survived. A complete mechanical assembly of a 350 drive was restored in 2002 and sits
                    in the collection of the Computer History Museum. According to a 2014

                    manufacturers, and the 1963 World Series. “The RAMAC data is thermodynamically stable for longer
                    than the expected lifetime of the universe,” said Joe Feng, one of the engineers who worked on the
                    restoration.

                <p>
                    From an isolated technical and engineering perspective, IBM created a storage medium that could last
                    much longer than a hundred years, even long beyond any reasonable definition of forever, on the
                    first try, without that even being the goal. Since the West Coast laboratory team was exploring a
                    novel design and process, they used extremely hardy materials and mechanisms, focusing on functional
                    reliability above all else. Yet today, 78 years later, the parts for the RAMAC are no longer being
                    manufactured, and the machines that fabricated those parts no longer exist. It took the
                    collaboration of several institutions to restore the necessary hardware to make possible the
                    recovery of data off of a single unit that survived. So many other RAMAC drives did not make it. The
                    theoretical longevity provided by its sturdy materials and robust mechanical design could not
                    guarantee its continued use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the present day, our records, our artifacts, our publications, and our art no longer only inhabit
                    the physical world. The intellectual and cultural output that we rely on and consume predominantly
                    lives on screens, electromagnetically stored in bits and transmitted through packets and wires. Over
                    the past two decades museums and archives have raised and spent billions of dollars to digitize
                    their holdings, to say nothing of the countless individual citizen archivists painstakingly
                    assembling digital collections on their own. Our hardware and software infrastructure is not built
                    for this reality. It is tailored to the short term, without any concern for its long-term
                    durability.

                <p>
                    This piece looks at a single question. If you, right now, had the goal of digitally storing
                    something for 100 years, how should you even begin to think about making that happen? How should the
                    bits in your stewardship be stored with such a target in mind? How do our methods and platforms look
                    when considered under the harsh unknowns of a century? There are plenty of worthy related subjects
                    and discourses that this piece does not touch at all. This is not a piece about the sheer volume of
                    data we are creating each day, and how we might store all of it. Nor is it a piece about the
                    extremely tough curatorial process of deciding what is and isn’t worth preserving and storing. It is
                    about longevity, about the potential methods of preserving what we make for future generations,
                    about how we make bits endure. <strong>If you had to store something for 100 years, how would you do
                        it?</strong> That’s it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even accounting for the human predilection for nice round numbers and the decimal system (10
                    fingers, 10 toes), 100 years is arbitrary. But 100 years is our metric precisely because it is
                    attainable. It is a scale within the outer possibilities of a single human lifetime but not of a
                    single human career. It is a duration that cannot be attained through individual force of will. It
                    requires planning and organization across at least one generational replacement. It is a broad
                    enough time period that the chance for social, economic, and technological change is absolute, yet
                    close enough that all context does not collapse. It is survival from the end of the Napoleonic Wars
                    to the beginning of World War I, from the invention of the shortwave radio to the age of Facebook,
                    from the reign of King Henry V to Martin Luther publishing his Ninety-five Theses, from the first
                    performance of Igor Stravinsky’s Rites of Spring to the release of Daft Punk’s final album, from the
                    Battle of Gettysburg to the signing of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, from the patenting of
                    the telephone to the release of the Apple I. We picked a century scale because most physical objects
                    can survive 100 years in good care. It is attainable, and yet we selected it because the design of
                    mainstream digital storage mediums are nowhere close to even considering this mark.

                    No single methodology that we discuss holds an obvious answer to this question, and that is fine,
                    particularly because professional archivists recommend making and storing multiple copies of
                    anything in multiple formats as a best practice. For example,

                    With digital storage there will always be two separate but equal battlefields of maintenance to
                    consider: maintenance of the digital holdings and software environments in which they live, and the
                    simple physical maintenance of the hardware and architecture that contain them. Every technology and
                    methodology we discuss keeps these sorts of principles in mind, that solutions are never singular
                    (not should they be). But we still try to analyze how their design and nature stacks up against the
                    rigors of a hundred-year scale. How they might each deal with the savage threats a century may
                    bring.

                <h2>Hard Drives</h2>
                <p>
                    Putting data on a hard drive is an act of writing. It is inscription with electromagnetism, which,
                    given the right connected hardware and software, allows near-instant reading.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s tempting to say that they don’t make hard drives like they used to, and to a certain extent,
                    it’s true. Seven decades of hard drive design have seen an unceasing sprint toward increased speed,
                    capacity, density, efficiency, and short-term reliability, all while decreasing physical size and
                    weight. Long-term reliability is a fringe concern. Hard drive manufacturers assume that anyone
                    serious about their data will replace their storage set-ups at least once a decade as technology
                    evolves.

                    Contemporary hard drives come in two main flavors: hard disk drives, where data is stored on a
                    spinning magnetic-coated metal platter, and solid state drives, where data is stored within
                    interconnected semiconductor cells constructed as logic gates. The basic design and principles of
                    contemporary hard disk drives are not all that different from RAMAC. A hard drive, both then and
                    now, works by using electromagnetism to store bits within two states, +M or -M, yes or no, 1 or 0
                    imprinted onto an electromagnetic disk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fundamental issue with hard disk drives is that they are mechanical. A platter spins. An arm
                    reads. There are motors involved. Actuators. Mechanisms. All small and inaccessible to regular
                    maintenance. Mechanical parts, as a rule, fail. When things move, they break. Even despite this
                    limitation, hard disk drives kept in the right conditions have the theoretical ability to last a
                    long time. The magnetic disks that the data is actually stored on can be hardy. Their manufactured
                    form factors seem to have stabilized over the last decade now that the race toward lighter and
                    smaller is the province of solid state drives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These SSDs, on the other hand, have the advantage of having no moving parts and high rates of
                    reading and writing. They dominate the world around us: sitting in our pockets, as the standard in
                    our computers, on every sort of server or system going for speed. In short-term everyday use, their
                    lack of moving parts means they can handle movement and physical shock without mechanical breakage.
                    This structure comes at a cost. Solid state drives have a finite lifespan, a limited number of times
                    each cell can be written before the insulation that holds charged electrons inside the miniature
                    transistors degrades. While these limits are high, and keep rising, they are still there, and when
                    operating on a century scale they immediately become a concern, especially in a use case where data
                    is being continually stored. SSDs also eventually lose their ability to store and hold data if left
                    unpowered and unused for too long. While the exact spans vary depending on the hardware, any
                    SSD-based long-term storage solution would require regular copying and re-copying, and careful
                    management and placement of the drives in optimal conditions, particularly in terms of temperature.
                    Even without mechanical parts, SSDs eventually fail with age. They have an expiration date.

                    For those serious about long-term storage, single hard drives are never used alone. In 1988, the
                    computer scientists Gareth Gibson, Randy Katz, and David Patterson proposed redundant arrays of
                    inexpensive disks (RAID), positing that multiple commercially available drives could be superior in
                    reliability to the centralized mainframe disk drives of the previous era. RAID is driven by the
                    realization that it can be cheaper, easier, and more resilient to replace one small element of a
                    large array than to replace one singular expensive piece of complicated equipment. It’s a component
                    of what could be called digital Fordism, a digital order marked by the mass production of
                    standardized hardware products meant for standardized software, used by the masses and specialists
                    alike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    RAID levels and variants have evolved over the ensuing decades, allowing for different optimal
                    configurations depending on the goal, chasing speed or capacity or reliability versus cost. For
                    example, RAID 6, which consists of two parity blocks, can sustain two drive failures and still not
                    result in a loss of data. Even the RAMAC, all those years ago, included a parity bit, an error
                    detection system. A single bit set to zero or one, odd or even, designed to count the number of
                    zeros or ones in a set of bits. If the parity bit has changed, an error has occurred. Higher-level
                    RAID systems provide an extreme version of this, parity at the drive level, which can not only
                    sustain multiple failures but detect and correct the affected data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    RAID arrays require maintenance, checks, and physical inspections when running over long periods.
                    Attaining century-scale storage using hard drive systems is less a question of technology than one
                    of institution-building, funding, real estate, logistics, culture, and a commitment to digitally
                    preserving everything surrounding and interfacing with your storage system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Say you set up multiple top-of-the-line fancy RAID 6 servers in a dozen perfectly climate controlled
                    bunkers around the world. To achieve century-scale storage, you would have to create, fund, and
                    ensure the survival of an institution to maintain, financially support, and remember them. This
                    institution would also have to preserve the file formats, software, hardware, operating system, and
                    every other digital element the data you are storing relies on, and continue to develop means to
                    access them. (This will be a recurring theme in this piece: Preserving digital data also requires
                    preserving the means to access that data, just as preserving a book requires preserving the language
                    in which it is written.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Past the scale of a human lifetime, technological solutions can become uncertain, and sometimes
                    shockingly counterintuitive. For example, it would be easy to say we should completely write off
                    contemporary SSDs for century-scale storage given the depth of commitment that they require. But the
                    fact that a long-term storage scheme using SSDs would require hypervigilant care and maintenance,
                    the development of a practice, could arguably be viewed as an advantage when it comes to
                    century-scale storage. Part of the reason books have the capacity to last over a century or even a
                    millennium is that eventually they <em>have</em> to be reprinted. Fragility, and the culture it
                    creates, can be an asset in inspiring the sort of care necessary for the long term. A system that
                    seeks the indestructible or infallible has the potential to encourage overconfidence, nonchalance,
                    and the ultimate enemy of all archives, neglect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other major advantage that the hard drive has—speed of accessibility—is also worth considering
                    as a factor in a century-scale storage solution. No need to swap out records, tapes, or reels. No
                    need to rely on a connection to a broader global network or an independent company that might go out
                    of business. Whatever data you want is there, in an instant. Your holdings can be shared and
                    showcased without relying on any other party. If the collection you’re preserving isn’t exclusively
                    for use 100 years from now, but rather is going to be used <em>throughout</em> the next 100 years,
                    speed of accessibility must be balanced against other factors to some degree, particularly the
                    security of storage. This is something that archivists, preservationists, and curators are
                    constantly balancing in the professional management of physical institutional collections. Even so,
                    accessibility can be a tremendous asset in building the sort of community that can survive over the
                    long term. Proper care and maintenance require resources, funding, and labor. It’s hard to induce
                    these while also hiding from the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When used for anything resembling “cold” storage—storage designed to not be readily accessible, that
                    can sit locked away for decades—hard drives present a risky selection. Fire, water, physical impact,
                    heat, moisture, and static electricity are constant threats. As RAMAC teaches us, even when the data
                    survives, hard drives are merely one component of an entire computer system that also needs to be
                    preserved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    RAMAC also shows us that hardware fragility is a choice. Hardware firms could make astronomically
                    more resilient products under a different incentive structure. Just like with buggy software, the
                    problem is not a lack of engineering know-how, but of shareholder pressure and the incentive for
                    short-term growth. As it stands, hard drives themselves are cheap and getting cheaper. You can buy a
                    24 TB hard drive for $439, over a hundred dollars less than the cost of a single month of 24 TB
                    storage on Amazon’s S3 cloud storage platform. We could have much hardier hard drives, but it would
                    likely come at increased financial cost, or a complete engineering reorientation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the right resources, hosting and using one’s own hard drive systems and servers could be a
                    reasonable component of a long-term storage effort. They are accessible, always ready to be copied
                    to other drives and mediums, and built, in a sense, to be upgraded to future versions of both
                    hardware and software. Having an on-site backup of a digital archive, completely within your
                    control, can be a worthy contingency if you are primarily relying on a distributed or cloud
                    solution. Having a hard drive system as part of such a design, designed to be upgraded or updated
                    every few years, is completely reasonable, as long as the need for future adaptation is understood
                    and properly funded. The very fact that hard disk drives are designed to be replaced incentivizes us
                    to think carefully about planning for the future. Whether we respond rationally to that incentive is
                    another story.

                    dominant method for how we store data, and how the software that retrieves that data runs. Software
                    platforms that don’t attempt to enforce the cloud as the default storage option are becoming an
                    endangered species. Of the 39 archives, libraries, and collectors I surveyed for this project, 27
                    use a cloud storage service as the primary site of their digital collections. Of those, 18 use a
                    separate cloud storage service as a secondary backup, and an additional four that have their primary
                    storage on-site or in a decentralized scheme use a cloud storage service as a backup.

                    The cloud is an aggregation of data centers. These data centers run servers, which rely on massive
                    arrays and combinations of the computational and hard drive technologies we have already discussed
                    to store large amounts of data for millions of clients. To store data in the cloud is to outsource
                    that storage, to give it over to a custodian, a guardian, whose sole purpose is receiving,
                    safeguarding, and delivering that data for whomever is willing to pay. This charge has proven
                    lucrative for the companies that have chosen to undertake it. While the biggest players often own
                    and run their own data centers, there are tens of thousands of smaller businesses that offer cloud
                    services to any number of clients, including the bigger services themselves.

                    The advantages of employing a cloud storage service are obvious. The burden of upgrading hardware
                    and software is offloaded onto specialists. The physical demands of architecture, of physical
                    protection from the elements, are no longer a concern for the customer. The cloud is accessible with
                    an internet connection, and part of a massive existing infrastructure with many other stakeholders.
                    This network effect of so many clients gives a sense of security unto itself, not unlike the “too
                    big to fail” culture of banking. If you store your data trove in the same place as massive

                    The cloud’s current data center regime is only designed for conditions of utter stability. The
                    physical threats to data centers are not dissimilar to the threats faced by traditional libraries,
                    with a few additions: fire, water, physical destruction, neglect of maintenance, power failures,
                    connection failures, theft, vandalism, and the constant forever need for software that works. During
                    the writing of this piece, in July 2024, a Crowdstrike update bug caused archives that were using
                    Microsoft Azure’s cloud storage services to lose access to their holdings. Natural disasters, wars,
                    and political upheavals are all capable of causing immediate and irrevocable disruptions. Despite
                    the internet’s founding dream, its birth ideal, of being a telecommunications network that could
                    survive a nuclear attack, it’s fairly certain any substantive nuclear exchange would render the
                    cloud unusable. Even aside from such nightmare scenarios, the cloud is made possible by a relatively

                    Cloud storage requires paying someone, an outside entity, for as long as you are engaged in the act
                    of storing. This can be more expensive than other methods (S3’s “Standard” option is $23 per TB as
                    of November 2024), especially over extremely long periods. Amazon S3 has tried to combat this by
                    offering a storage class for slower but more permanent storage, “Glacier,” designed to be
                    competitive with offline cold storage options, by separating storage pricing from retrieval pricing
                    (their “Flexible Retrieval” option is $3.60 per TB as of November 2024). But you still have to pay
                    them. Every month or every year. Forever. You can turn off the machines that you own for a while and
                    then turn them back on, and everything you stored will still be there, but if you stop paying your
                    cloud storage fee the data is gone, probably forever.

                    The cloud requires trust. Assessing the cloud from the perspective of century-scale storage is less
                    about the technical abilities and configurations on offer than about organizational structures, and
                    even values. Right now, the dominant cloud storage options are exclusively administered by
                    companies. In November of 2018, at an all-hands meeting in Seattle, an Amazon employee asked CEO and
                    founder Jeff Bezos what he had learned from the recent bankruptcy of Sears. “Amazon is not too big

                    acquired or split up into pieces or go bankrupt or decline into something much smaller or are
                    upended by catastrophic geopolitical events.

                    It could be that data storage service companies are immune to this trend. Among the oldest companies
                    in the United States that are not farms, pubs, breweries, or inns are several insurance companies.
                    The Philadelphia Contributorship (1752), Insurance Company of North America (now known as Chubb,
                    1792), and Baltimore Equitable (1794) are all in their third century of business. This is also true
                    globally (Bilsener Gilde of Germany, 1642; Hamburger Feuerkasse of Germany, 1676; Lloyd’s of London,
                    1688). These are companies engaged in the long-term management of assets, fluent in risk. One could
                    imagine a storage service or data center adopting the sort of culture that might lead to similar
                    longevity, but the cloud is so far the province of companies that are mostly nonspecialized, with
                    cultures focused on driving growth-exploding paradigm shifts rather than stability.

                    Over the long term, there is serious risk that the three dominant players in cloud storage, or other
                    upstart firms that wish to follow in their ilk, discontinue their services out of necessity,
                    preference, or optimization as they move onto whatever the next shiny thing is that they believe can

                    seem to lose a sense of the importance of their work. Even when the institutions they work for don’t
                    pay them enough, this sense of reverence is retained. Every single day they are doing their best to

                    observed their desire to care for the personal, the sense that they should make something that works
                    so people don’t lose their treasured memories. They also strive for reliability on behalf of
                    customers that are businesses, understanding that a donut shop needs their accounting records to
                    work or they might shut down. But outside of a rare moment of marketing and a few moments of
                    rhetoric, I feel comfortable generalizing that a culture of stewardship, a sense of the stakes, is
                    not widespread within technology companies, nor building it a priority.

                    At this precise moment all of these services mention AI (a lot) and how it’s going to change
                    everything. “Is your infrastructure AI-ready?” Microsoft Azure’s landing page asks. Google Cloud
                    encourages you to “build what’s next in generative AI.” Two years ago their marketing materials
                    mentioned web3 and the metaverse (a lot) and how it was going to change everything, and how if your
                    business did not adapt you were going to be left behind—yet those sentiments no longer appear.

                    “I didn’t even know we had any clients like that,” a Microsoft product manager told me when I asked
                    how she felt about protecting archives. “I have a hard time convincing anyone else it matters,” an
                    Amazon engineer said. “There are some higher-ups that genuinely seem to care more, but that doesn’t
                    filter down.”

                    The cloud does not exist in a vacuum. It is dependent on a far-reaching fabric of interactions,
                    telecoms, internet service providers, and hardware manufacturers, all of which are motivated by
                    timescales far removed from a century (often the daily whims of the market and a fiduciary
                    responsibility to shareholders to maximize returns on a quarterly basis). The Jack Welch school of
                    shareholder supremacy is completely incompatible with the sorts of values that would ensure a cloud
                    storage provider would reliably exist for a century.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the network effect of mass reliance on the cloud, one would hope there is a corporate culture
                    of responsibility around safety and the seriousness of their charge. But such corporate cultures,
                    even when they do exist, are fragile.

                    Another manifestation of the cloud is as a means with which digital products are currently offered,
                    sold, and consumed. Digital copies of books, film, music, games, and journalism, some released under
                    subscription models, some available on digital marketplaces, are all part of our cloud environment.

                    A potential approach to century-scale storage for any published work of literature, knowledge, art,
                    or science would be to simply trust rights holders and IP developers to keep all that they offer
                    safe until it enters the public domain, but under current conditions such trust is impossible. The
                    publicly traded corporation, as an entity operating in today’s paradigm of shareholder supremacy and
                    today’s copyright law, cannot be trusted as a partner in the preservation of anything. We have seen
                    video game companies fail to preserve their own IP and then ruthlessly pursue litigation when fans
                    attempt pick up the slack, film studios refuse to release entire films and shelve television shows
                    in order to claim write-offs and avoid paying residuals, digital marketplaces disable content that

                    This process is constant and ongoing. During the short period in which this piece was written,
                    Paramount unexpectedly deleted the entire archive of <em>MTV News</em>, including work which does
                    not appear to have been saved by the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine; GameStop abruptly shut down
                    <em>Game Informer</em> and disappeared their archives, which as recently as 2011 was one of the
                    three highest circulating magazines in the US; and reporting revealed that some of the archives of
                    some of the most storied local newspapers in the country, including the <em>Village Voice</em>, had
                    been taken over by LLM-generated clickbait. These may seem like small things. They are not. In the
                    case of <em>MTV News</em>, two decades of documentation that included some of the most impactful
                    moments in music history were put at risk of loss.

                    While various international law frameworks for the protection of cultural and intellectual heritage
                    during wars have existed since the 19th century, no such frameworks exist for peacetime. If they
                    did, they might radically change our capacity to trust both the custodians of the cloud and
                    corporate rights holders. A different legal and civic order would affect this entire analysis. But
                    for now, the cloud is only governed by itself.

                    The oldest vinyl record I own is a 1951 pressing of Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat
                    Minor, played by Vladimir Horowitz and the NBC Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. On the crimson
                    cover an illustrated pair of disembodied hands play an angled keyboard. It’s worth between $3 and
                    $12 at present. The record is a re-press, as the recording was made in 1943 (of sheet music first
                    published in 1875 and revised into its final form in 1890).

                    The most famous examples of faith in the stability of records as a storage format are currently 15.2
                    billion miles and 12.7 billion miles from the Earth respectively. They are traveling at 38,026.77
                    mph and 34,390.98 mph relative to Earth, beyond the heliosphere in interstellar space. The Voyager
                    Golden Records housed on the Voyager space probes are made from gold- and nickel-plated copper
                    instead of vinyl. They contain greetings in 55 human languages; 26 musical recordings including the
                    works of Blind Willie Johnson, Chuck Berry, and Johann Sebastian Bach; field recordings of nature;
                    and 116 encoded images of life. Each record is designed to last over a billion years.

                    The Golden Record is the ultimate outlier, a small preview of what might be achieved if a society
                    brought real resources to the preservation and curation of cultural production. Most removable
                    storage is not designed to travel the cosmos and last for over a billion years. Still, even in their
                    less durable versions, records, tapes, and optical discs represent a storage regime that is both
                    replicable and distributable, as well as standardizable enough that consumer hardware can access it,
                    and display it immediately. These formats are by nature air-gapped, immune to cyberattack, buggy
                    software updates, and accidental deletions.

                    Optimized for the rigors of a past era of physical commerce, removable media formats all have some
                    degree of shelf stability, but like everything else they wither under the stresses of time. Vinyl
                    records hate heat and wear out with each listen. Cassette tapes slowly shed their oxide layer,
                    especially under high heat and humidity, while magnetic fields, even those resulting from small
                    consumer electronics, wreak havoc on a tape’s magnetic particles. VHS tapes experience similar
                    afflictions. Fungi attack floppy disks. Motion picture film reels are tormented by an array of
                    maladies. The cellulose nitrate film base used in the first half of the 20th century is known to
                    disintegrate into dust when it isn’t literally exploding into spectacular flame. The cellulose
                    acetate that replaced it suffers from “vinegar syndrome,” where its acetate base decays, emitting a
                    pungent smell. Polyester film is troubled by fading colors. Film archives now store many reels in
                    humidity-controlled frozen vaults to slow down these reactions.

                <p>
                    Digital removable form factors like CDs, DVDs, and other optical discs are plagued by chaotic and
                    unpredictable chemical meltdowns that erode their playback capability. There is no consensus on a
                    singular cause of “disc rot” because manufacturing standards for CDs and DVDs were so varied that
                    it’s impossible to identify a universal accelerant. Some discs appear totally fine, ready to last
                    hundreds of years. Others seem almost like they were designed to degenerate after an appallingly
                    short amount of time, as if they were not Céline Dion’s Greatest Hits but intentionally
                    self-destructing messages out of <em>Mission Impossible</em>. Some discs bronze or speckle. Some
                    shed little strips of their reflective layer. Some go bizarrely translucent, a magic trick, as if
                    their previous existence were an illusion.

                    Humidity, pests, light, magnetism, and heat can destroy almost anything. Mitigating them can help
                    preserve almost anything.

                    With the right conditions and care, any of these formats can last an awfully long time, but at that
                    point they are artifacts like any other physical singular works selected for preservation. They are
                    sculptures, tapestries, costumes, or paintings. The storage medium is just as much the treasured
                    object as the content it is holding. And the ability to play or access the media on them must also
                    be preserved. In 2021, lawyer and FOIA expert Michael Ravnitzky filed a request for copies of video
                    footage of a lecture by legendary computer scientist Admiral Grace Hopper that were present in the
                    National Security Agency’s archives.

                    If you don’t plan on preserving a turntable along with a record collection, you’d better be able to
                    build one. This is where analog formats have a potential long-term advantage over digital ones. The
                    creators of the Voyager Golden Record reckoned that it’s easier to communicate instructions on how
                    to build a record player to a future viewer than it is to communicate how to build a computer.
                    Anthropomorphic issues when theorizing billion-year-in-the-future interactions with aliens aside, it
                    certainly seems true that constructing a simple mechanical device is easier than constructing a
                    multi-level hardware and software system.

                    For the purposes of century-scale storage, a knock against these formats might be that as mass
                    consumer products they are already largely obsolete, replaced by a vast streaming infrastructure
                    that intangibly beams content down from the cloud. However, even in a minority capacity, many of
                    them continue to have lives as products. Vinyl records have been fully resurrected now for over a
                    decade, having even surpassed sales of CDs, the format that supposedly marked their demise.

                    In 1998, the Japanese Diet passed the Electronic Books Preservation Act, which required certain tax
                    and accounting data to be stored digitally for 100 years. The government created and mandated a
                    quality standard for optical discs that could reach this mark. Pioneer developed an optical disc
                    drive, the BDR-WX01DM, and archival-level discs to meet this standard. Equally promising are
                    M-DISCs, a slightly thicker Blu-ray disc design manufactured by both Ritek and Verbatim, which claim
                    a lifespan of 1000 years when properly stored. M-DISCs passed both ECMA and ISO/IEC standards with a
                    rating of several hundred years, and different durability and stress tests of M-DISCs have confirmed
                    a high degree of resilience depending on conditions. But both formats are new, and these claims are
                    untested in temporal reality. And like all other removable media, they require a physical space to
                    be held, kept safe, and remembered.

                    Tape drives, which have been used for mainframe computer storage since the 1950s, are remarkably
                    enduring. Now specifically designed for long term “cold” storage, tape drives have high capacities. As

                    “a single robotic tape library can contain up to 278 petabytes of data. Storing that much data on
                    compact discs would require more than 397 million of them, which if stacked would form a tower more
                    than 476 kilometers high.” Unlike the magnetic tape in cassettes or VHS tapes, the tape itself is
                    much more resilient to physical degradation, and enclosed in cartridges made of heartier materials.
                    Tape requires far less energy and computational minding than other types of computer hard drive
                    systems.

                    Tape also has the advantage of being relatively cheap, far cheaper over the medium term than
                    cloud-based offerings or constantly upgrading your own server or hard drive hardware. In 2021, IBM

                    It’s no accident that tape drives
                    are the standard for most large-scale cold storage. Most film companies and film libraries, banks,
                    insurance agencies, law firms, and national archives keep a copy of at least some of their data on
                    magnetic tape.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, tape drive systems, depending on their complexity, can have high initial set-up costs. They
                    are not currently produced, sold, or advertised to individual consumers. Depending on the exact
                    hardware, writing to tape drives can be slow—slow enough that updating them incorrectly can even
                    threaten the integrity of the data being stored. The drives that write to tapes are not designed to
                    be regularly moved. The tapes themselves are primarily designed to sit in the perfect space you made
                    for them. They are vulnerable to anything that might threaten the physical site within which they
                    are contained. They are also almost entirely meant for use in a singular system and cannot claim the
                    advantage of the naturally occuring decentralizations that follow when products are developed for
                    consumer use.

                    Judged against other available storage technologies in a vacuum, away from the organizational,
                    financial, architectural, and social structures around them, tape storage is probably the best bet
                    for single-site storage of a large digital collection over a few decades, as long as that collection
                    never has to be updated. But tape’s life is still measured in decades at most, designed to be
                    replaced by a successor system long before we reach our 100-year mark. Tape drive vendors still
                    typically market their competitive pricing advantages on scales of only five or ten years. And tape
                    still requires physical caretaking, space, and a watchful eye.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While more expensive tape systems allow for fast data retrieval times, the very fact that they are
                    not easily accessible is one of their trademarks, providing the security of an air gap against
                    digital threats. This lack of accessibility is both a strength and a weakness. As previously
                    discussed, the immediate and instant accessibility of one’s holdings can be a positive factor in
                    preservation over a century scale. Any solution best designed for a hidden bunker, a place to be
                    kept from the world, from the public, from society, runs the risk of not being able to inspire the
                    social, political, and financial conditions to ensure proper care and maintenance.

                <p>
                    We have grouped analog and digital removable storage methods, some meant for mass consumption and
                    some meant for one-off institutional storage, all within the same analysis because they share the
                    possibility for both mobility and replication detached from the systems that read them. It is
                    absolutely possible to encode Google Chrome onto a vinyl record, just as we can encode the
                    thousand-year-old musical compositions of Hildegard of Bingen in digital file formats, and just as
                    the Voyager Golden Record encoded visual images of Earth onto its grooves.

                    Let’s imagine a world where six months from now, all digital music somehow flashes out of existence.
                    Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, and every other digital music service lose their holdings. Every hard
                    drive in the world with music on it is erased. The record label backups are gone. Let’s pretend a
                    digital copy of Sabrina Carpenter’s album <em>Short n’ Sweet</em> accidentally survives on both a single tape
                    drive in a library, and on the thousands of records, tapes, and CDs sold to fans. Even as products
                    of the streaming era, where physical copies represent a mere fraction of how people are listening to
                    music, if you asked me to bet on which would make it a century in this imaginary scenario, I’d bet
                    on the records, tapes, and CDs—and the fans, their heirs, and successor fans. I would bet on
                    whatever Discogs-esque service exists in 2124.

                    If this project were called “Millennia-Scale Storage” the historical record would suggest two
                    particularly successful methods for ensuring the survival of written and visual media—carving in
                    stone or inscribing on a clay tablet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Humans painted, engraved, and shaped stone for tens of thousands of years before anything resembling
                    civilization or written history. Many of these works endure, only ceasing to exist through violent
                    modification or annihilation, whether by a human being or natural force.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thousands of years later, starting as early as 9000 BCE with simple small counting tokens and
                    reaching widespread adoption around 3000 BCE, ancient Sumerians, Babylonians, Minoans, Mycenaeans,
                    and Hittites wrote with sharp styluses on pieces of wet clay, which were then left to dry in the sun
                    or baked in a kiln. These practices spread relatively quickly. We have over half a million of these
                    tablets today, and the number of survivors continues to go up with new recoveries and excavations.
                    These Bronze and Iron Age writings are in extraordinary shape, resistant to many would-be means of
                    destruction. They encompass government archives, commercial documents, lists of battles, receipts,
                    letters, debates, hymns, essays, laws, stories, mathematical theorems, recipes, and medical texts.
                    The collection includes the now- internet-famous “complaint tablet to Ea-nāṣir,” a customer
                    complaint (regarding the substandard quality of already-paid-for copper ingots) that has survived
                    over 3,700 years. We have 1,800 years of astronomical records, the <em>Epic of Gilgamesh</em>, and
                    382 diplomatic letters from Akhenaten, the pharaoh of Egypt, to neighboring major powers. The clay
                    tablets reach across an unfathomable stretch of time with an almost astonishing ease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A brief look at historical sites around the world demonstrates the possibilities of not only
                    physicalizing treasured digital archives, but of turning them into architecture, or using the
                    architecture that surrounds them in ways that can enhance the possibility of century-scale survival.
                    Computers are made of rocks, after all. Maybe we should be reversing the process and writing source
                    code in stone, engraving our most important functions into walls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reasons for us to not resurrect these processes are obvious. Both stone inscription and clay
                    tablet writing are inordinately time-intensive, slow, immutable, limited, and unbearably heavy. Even
                    laser engraving on standardized surfaces costs hundreds of dollars for relatively short phrases, not
                    to mention the cost of the stone itself. The current typical cost of a headstone, which usually only
                    mentions a name and some dates, is $1,000–$3,000. To encode all 4.7 billion words of English
                    Wikipedia (as of October 20, 2024) into stone would require tens of thousands of people and tens of
                    billions of dollars. Any correction or update could force a restart. To encode digital images, one
                    would not only have to include billions of characters of code, but instructions to build a computer,
                    operating system, and software capable of interpreting that massive set of encoded characters, and
                    then input them without making any errors, a task that could take human teams centuries itself.

                    Monuments are a target that require protection. Every war is a war on architecture. Physical
                    monuments, particularly those that are contemporary, don’t always enjoy the benefits of national and
                    cultural security. Without the constant guard and competence of a security force, the heaviest stone
                    is easily destroyable, even by forces without access to advanced weaponry. The Georgia Guidestones
                    were a mysterious 19-foot-tall, 118-ton granite monument created in 1980 by anonymous private
                    citizens that espoused a set of ideological precepts in eight languages to guide humanity
                    post-apocalypse. For 808 words, their construction cost over $400,000 in today’s dollars. They were
                    bombed and destroyed by unknown vandals in July of 2022. Intended for a far-flung future, they only
                    lasted 42 years.

                    More modern methods for preserving the written word are compelling in their own way. My bookshelves
                    contain plenty of works over 100 years old: Sumerian texts telling the story of the ancient
                    Mesopotamian goddess Inanna, the works of Homer, Sappho, and Euripides, of Marco Polo, Miguel de
                    Cervantes, and Mary Shelley. These attained century-scale storage by being printed and reprinted,
                    copied, protected, translated, and adapted into new formats, with these burdens distributed over
                    centuries of caretakers. Even as individual objects, books can last quite a while when stored and
                    cared for in the proper conditions. I have a few dozen that comfortably pass the hundred-year mark.
                    The oldest book I own is a volume of Cicero’s <em>Orator</em> printed in Venice in 1554. The specific object
                    is not valuable or important (I bought it for £40 in London in 2014), and yet it has traveled
                    through space and time, conquering centuries, families, and continents without any evidence of
                    having entered the care of a professional archivist or institution. It is still a functional book.
                    The pages turn. The pale vellum binding stands straight. It survives.

                <p>
                    This is supposed to be a piece about the best options for making digital storage last a century or
                    more, with an implied focus on fancy storage technologies and novel archival schemes. But even
                    today, if our goal is storing information for a century, we should not underrate the power of print.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Print books in physical codex form naturally decentralize to an extreme degree, finding their way
                    into not only institutions but the collections of individuals. They are like plants whose seeds have
                    adapted to float and spread in the wind, engineered to end up exactly where you would least suspect,
                    and persist. Even small self-published print runs of artist zines can end up in the Museum of Modern
                    Art or the National Archives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike digital storage, the survival of print requires physical libraries, even if those libraries
                    are shelves in an individual’s home. It requires that those libraries be protected from fire, water,
                    and pests like silverfish. While the cotton- and linen-infused long-fiber paper of centuries past is
                    remarkably sturdy and robust, mechanical wood-pulp paper has shorter fibers, and is susceptible to
                    acidification as it ages.

                    The advantage of print is that it can be a practice. What was printed before can be reprinted. The
                    downside is that, in order to take advantage of the full preservational powers of the codex form,
                    what you are saving and printing has to be valued by the public. The printing press is a creature of
                    the market, built to replicate based on demand. Still, just as with physical copies of music and
                    film, the multiplicative scale of even small print runs dwarfs what you see with most digital backup
                    methods. Even small independent publishers of edgy literature routinely print 5,000 books as a
                    starting point for a print run. Tiny poetry presses regularly print 1,000–2,000 copies of a
                    collection. In our current streaming era, how often do thousands of people voluntarily keep the
                    exact same stored digital object on their own hard drive? Increasingly few. Physical libraries and
                    readers accomplish this daily, to great effect.

                    The issue with books is their number. There are already a lot of them. The volume of books runs up
                    against the human capacity to care for them. In 2010,

                    Estimates vary, but
                    each year somewhere between one and four million more are published. As of 2022, the Library of
                    Congress, the most well-funded library on Earth, has only 25 million books. Given the physical space
                    storing print requires, the scope of human publishing necessitates curation and culling. Millions of
                    volumes of text can be stored digitally on a hard drive the size of your fingertip, volumes that in
                    physical form would require multiple buildings. The greatest challenge to the century-scale storage
                    potential of the print codex is that once a book is 100 years old, there is no guarantee anyone will
                    care enough about what lies within it to take on the demands of its care.

                    the world, so that no disaster, war, or sudden loss of funding could ever threaten a digital

                    Still, some attempts at decentralization have been more successful. LOCKSS (Lots of Copies Keep
                    Stuff Safe) is a digital preservation strategy, protocol, and software developed by Victoria Reich
                    and David Rosenthal in 1999 at Stanford Libraries. Rosenthal has spent decades working on and
                    writing about the possibilities and pitfalls in long-term digital storage (this piece

                    For LOCKSS, multiple copies of academic journals are
                    stored across a distributed network; each copy in the system periodically checks itself against
                    other
                    copies for damage and discrepancies, a process of polling and repair. They whisper to each other,
                    sharing checksums, ensuring that their copies remain uncorrupted. If a node detects a discrepancy,
                    an injury, it sends out a silent SOS, and another node, a digital Samaritan, comes to its aid,
                    offering a pristine copy to heal the wound. But each node is autonomous, individually responsible
                    for tending to its own copies and paying its subscriptions.

                <p>
                    What LOCKSS represents is an attempt to put a decentralized and reliable storage system within the
                    control of a community. The result is a network of 80 research and public libraries
                    <a href="https://www.lockss.org/gln" class="footnote-link" target="_blank">sharing</a>

                    “custody of the scholarly record on library-owned
                    storage, not in the cloud.” Members of LOCKSS pay a fee based on their budgets, an attempt to spread
                    the financial burden beyond one institution.

                <p>
                    LOCKSS is careful. It is narrowly tailored, built to respect copyright holders and institutional
                    administrations. It is limited to 13,200 journals and 23,600 books under a set of labored agreements
                    with publishers. The growth of the system is constrained by its strict enforcement of intellectual
                    property rights and the inherent costs of maintaining a place within the network. These costs are
                    ongoing and persistent, and unlike specific individual works that eventually enter the public
                    domain, the current regime of academic publishers of journals and periodicals intends to continually
                    publish new material to be held under copyright, and charge for it, forever. That LOCKSS achieved
                    its scale in the current copyright regime is unusual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fundamental idea of LOCKSS—mutual decentralized stewardship—recalls much earlier forms of online
                    file-sharing. As soon as computers could talk to each other, people used platforms like bulletin
                    board systems, Usenet, and IRC to share data with all those who were connected. For a brief moment,
                    in the late 1990s and 2000s, file-sharing (and later, torrent systems) spread massive amounts of
                    music and video files with impunity despite limited bandwidth. Such structures, of course, allowed
                    intellectual property rights to be ignored with abandon. Copies of goods that were contemporaneously
                    being sold could be quickly acquired for free. And there were other problems. Malware was rampant,
                    the time-intensive burden of collection management was shifted onto individuals, and what was
                    available was completely dependent on the whims of the uploaders. Most significantly, these
                    platforms were all run on centralized servers, which meant that once courts and states attacked
                    them, they vanished. If decentralized storage was to have a future, it would have to be one where
                    any user could not access the files of any other user, where collections were walled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The progeny of these platforms still exist, and in some cases, thrive, though they are no longer a
                    dominant means of distributing media. Sci-Hub, Library Genesis, and Z-Library offer academic journal
                    articles for free to anyone who wants to download them, flouting intellectual property laws and
                    invoking the right to science and culture under Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human
                    Rights. These platforms are, in effect, an illegal, decentralized mirror of initiatives like LOCKSS,
                    piracy that also functions as an insurance policy in the case of a future global meltdown. The
                    singular and well-defined missions of these efforts help make them popular and contribute to their
                    survival, despite their murky legal status and the vast powers arrayed against them. Their
                    tremendous narrative strength—promoting universalist causes against overwhelming odds, not to
                    mention the mythical appeal of being outlaws—has resulted in fierce protection from fans and has
                    incentivized care and stewardship from this loyal community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s worth considering the efficacy of piracy and the intentional breaking of intellectual property
                    law as a long-term preservation tactic.

                    and the failures of the current corporate and institutional orders to properly care for them,
                    piracy-based media preservation efforts are more likely to survive catastrophic future events than
                    traditional institutions. On the other hand, as the notorious prosecution of Aaron Swartz or the
                    legal cases against the Internet Archive demonstrate, engaging in copyright infringement at scale
                    runs the constant risk of sanction and shutdown from state actors.

                    Fully decentralized systems present a more elusive target for such actions. The InterPlanetary File
                    System is a decentralized protocol designed to create a peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing
                    files in a distributed structure. Instead of relying on centralized servers, IPFS uses content
                    addressing, where each file is identified by a unique hash derived from its contents. This allows a
                    specific file to be retrieved from any node in the network that stores the corresponding hash, all
                    shared on a global network built to recognize and communicate multiple instances of the same file.
                    IPFS functions like one giant torrent but allows users to download or seed only a part of the whole.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2017, when Turkish courts banned Wikipedia, IPFS allowed an entire copy to be distributed to
                    bypass the ban. After crackdowns on the aforementioned Library Genesis and Z-Library, their holdings
                    were migrated to IPFS. The long-term success of holdings stored with IPFS are dependent on the
                    digital archival practices of each individual participant, and reliant on a level of participation
                    that can be, as any open-source developer can tell you, fragile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2017 Protocol Labs, the developers of IPFS, launched Filecoin, a cryptocurrency-based digital
                    storage system partially based on the IPFS architecture. It attempts to incentivize participation by
                    compensating those who provide storage space with a cryptocurrency. Filecoin is not alone. Arweave,
                    Storj, Sia, BitTorrent Token, and Safecoin are all variations on the same theme, new attempts at an
                    older dream: creating a market system that can connect all the unused digital storage scattered
                    about the planet to those who might need it. We have always had vast surpluses of unused digital
                    storage space and no viable marketplace to harness this excess, which could allow those with extra
                    storage to profit and give those looking to store access to a cheap distributed market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fully blockchain-based systems, where each new piece of data gets added to the end of a chain that
                    is then replicated in every instance and every node, have a complete “persistence mechanism.” The
                    entire record of data is stored in an immutable, decentralized ledger across multiple nodes,
                    ensuring transparency but consuming significant storage due to the entire transaction history
                    existing at every point. Because this mechanism is not viable for the storage of any large amounts
                    of data, most cryptocurrency-based storage solutions rely on contract-based persistence mechanisms,
                    often used in so-called “smart contracts,” and thus store only essential data directly within the
                    contract. This approach avoids the replication of the entire blockchain history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coin-based storage systems work by incentivizing users to store the data entrusted to them. They are
                    designed to constantly verify that storage providers are storing an unaltered, undamaged copy of
                    that which has been entrusted to them, and confirm that that storage is continuing over time. To
                    Filecoin’s credit, rather than walling off their system, they offer storage solutions compatible
                    with Amazon S3. They appear to be genuinely interested in storing archival data and working with
                    archival and educational institutions. Their associated charitable organization, the Filecoin
                    Foundation
                    for the Decentralized Web, provided financial support to the Library Innovation Lab at Harvard Law
                    School,

                    liquidity all create potential long-term issues. Lastly, as Rosenthal also points out, if
                    contributing storage space to these services does become profitable, there is a profound risk of
                    centralization of storage providers: If providing storage generates revenue, that revenue will
                    centralize because it is incentivized to centralize, just like other supposedly decentralized
                    offerings in an unregulated market context. The untested legal status of these systems also poses
                    potential problems. Storing copies of copyrighted intellectual property could lead to problems
                    within the market itself if providers in certain jurisdictions are

                    None of these schemes have so far proven that they can function,
                    let alone thrive, as functional viable marketplaces for a sustained period of time, nor that they
                    can reliably incentivize storage in times of strife or scarcity. Since the development of
                    large-scale trading civilizations, no region on Earth has seen a century pass without a significant
                    economic crisis, shock, or shortage. On the century scale, these events can be severe, capable of
                    toppling regimes, destroying nation-states, and sparking conflicts that lead to deaths measured in
                    the millions. To directly peg an archival storage method to a market system with stakeholders that
                    feed on volatility is equivalent to burying your hard drives in a 100-year flood zone. If a
                    cryptocurrency-backed decentralized storage solution is going to be viable in the long term for
                    cultural and intellectual institutions and collectors—organizations and individuals that tend to
                    have extremely sensitive budgetary practices—they have to find a way to limit and mitigate the
                    effect of these shocks on their pricing.

                    Blockchain-based implementations also run the risk of being intellectually dismissed or even
                    politically targeted by those turned off by the speculative financial use of the technology and its
                    tainted history of grift, fraud, rent-seeking, greed, and anti-statist techno-libertarian fantasies.
                    I know this because I am one of those who harbor such instinctive negative reactions. Even if you
                    believe these reactions are not fair, they are an excellent example of the human volatilities one
                    must consider in evaluating a technology for century-scale storage. If you construct your storage
                    scheme using a culturally and politically volatile technology, that in itself presents a risk long
                    after you are gone. As with every other method described here, the method must be preserved along
                    with what is being stored.

                    The cryptocurrency and blockchain communities, and their related firms, have so far invested little
                    in the necessary digital-preservation grunt work that might allow their protocols, and the software
                    and hardware those protocols run on, to endure. Crypto firms have also not mounted any significant
                    challenges to the centralized hardware and telecommunications companies that make their models
                    possible. If they are serious about wanting truly decentralized and resilient solutions to help
                    store human cultural memory, they should use their resources to attack, subvert, and replace the
                    centralized telecommunications, hardware, and software behemoths that they currently rely upon. A
                    crypto community that is serious about a decentralized internet should be in an all-out war with the
                    Verizons, AT&amp;Ts, Comcasts, Starlinks, and Spectrums of the world, and treating the dominance of a
                    firm like NVIDIA with utter hostility.

                <p>
                    But these critiques are secondary. We can imagine an alternate decentralized storage technology that
                    doesn’t relate to cryptocurrency at all and still arrive at the real evaluative question present
                    here: that of centralization versus decentralization in archival practices itself.

                    opens with the
                    anecdote of a 16th-century Dutch scholar arriving to his appointment at the Holy Roman Emperor’s
                    library to find it in a state of utter neglect and destitution. The printing press had only been
                    around a century, but in that short time, the greatest enemy of archives—neglect—had already struck.
                    We can fret about all manner of dramatic disasters. Global thermonuclear war, asteroid impacts,
                    caldera volcanoes, x-risks, Skynet, cultural revolutions, second comings, alien invasions,
                    Malthusian crises, birthrate collapses, pandemics, solar flares, and Local Group supernovae. We can
                    try to engineer around every variety of society-threatening catastrophe, the seas boiling and the
                    ground rumbling and the cities burning. We can imagine how decentralization could provide security
                    against destructive scenarios, how it would protect an archive in case of invasion, fire, bombing,
                    and cyberattack. But none of those are what primarily kills archives. Boring human neglect kills
                    archives.

                    There are certainly situations where centralization has proven disastrous. In Bosnia, the National
                    Archives in Sarajevo were seriously damaged during a series of demonstrations and riots in 2014. In
                    1984, the Sikh Reference Library in Amritsar, Punjab was targeted in an Indian military operation
                    and its entire collection confiscated. It has not yet been returned and is presumed lost. The Boxer
                    Rebellion in 1900 claimed Beijing’s Hanlin Academy library. The only known surviving manuscripts of
                    both <em>Beowulf</em> and <em>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</em> survived a fire at the Cottonian
                    Library in London in 1731. Other volumes were not so lucky. History is replete with the destruction
                    and loss of libraries and books. World War II alone destroyed or damaged millions of library-held
                    volumes.

                    “For Gibbon, the Library of Alexandria
                    was one of the
                    great achievements of the classical world and its destruction—which he concludes was due to a long
                    and gradual process of neglect and growing ignorance—was a symbol of the barbarity that overwhelmed
                    the Roman Empire, allowing civilization to leach away the ancient knowledge that was being
                    re-encountered and appreciated in his own day. The fires were major incidents in which many books
                    were lost, but the institution of the library disappeared more gradually both through organizational
                    neglect and through the gradual obsolescence of the papyrus scrolls themselves.”

                <p>
                    If your goal in century-scale storage is avoiding kinetic, Hollywood-ready catastrophes, then
                    decentralized solutions are ideal, but whether they can combat neglect is less clear. If a
                    decentralized scheme wants to be successful at century scale, this is what they should and must
                    attack.

                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the few clear benefits of centralization is that it inspires care. If people know something
                    is important, of value, potentially even the last of something, they tend to fight every day to
                    protect it. The history of war, strife, and disaster is also the history of archivists, curators,
                    artists, scientists, and passionate Samaritan bystanders saving works from impending destruction at
                    great personal risk and sacrifice. The survivorship bias present in the human canon is merely an
                    echo of thousands of acts of heroism.

                    The Bibliothèque nationale de France, previously the Royal Library, has survived 16 kings, two
                    emperors, five republics, six full-scale revolutions, the Hundred Years’ War, the French Civil War,
                    the Italian Wars, the Thirty Years’ War, the Franco-Dutch War, the Nine Years’ War, the War of the
                    Spanish Succession, the Seven Years’ War, the Napoleonic Wars, the Franco-Prussian War, World War I,
                    and World War II. It has, at times, safeguarded works that had no other known caretakers. The
                    Bibliothèque nationale de France is not an outlier nor a case of survivorship bias, as many national
                    libraries attain century-scale storage even while withstanding violent changes to the states they
                    serve.

                <p>
                    A fairly large portion of human literature, science, art, and music has survived precisely because
                    it has been relatively centralized. Despite the obvious risks of putting all one’s eggs in one
                    basket, we should not dismiss centralization too quickly. Can we really trust the anonymous
                    contributors to a distributed cryptocoin-backed storage service to operate with the same level of
                    care as professional librarians in a centralized institution or obsessive individual collectors? Can
                    we trust that in the face of a disaster, malicious government, or marauding force that they might
                    fight to protect their holdings? Or would they instead relax in the knowledge that somewhere else
                    there is another copy, that write-blockers, error-correcting checksums, and encryptions ensure that
                    they are not alone? Therein lies the problem for distributed systems: What if every other node in
                    the distributed network also assumes this security?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over a hundred years, eventually, the havocs come. A distributed system runs the risk of
                    overconfidence and a lack of individual responsibility. During World War II, librarians and curators
                    in centralized institutions smuggled works directly out of the hands of the Gestapo and SS. Some
                    refused to flee and stayed working under occupation at great personal risk, even pretending to work
                    with the enemy (thus also risking targeting from resistance forces), while compiling ledgers that
                    tracked the destinations of looted collections. Librarians in Lithuania concealed ancient Jewish
                    texts in local church basements. In Poland, they hid 13th- century monastery manuscripts in bank
                    vaults. Whole archives were moved across borders, under darkness, with brutal and certain death
                    stalking anyone who might be caught in the act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still, there are plenty of examples of successful distributed or decentralized efforts worth
                    considering—some of the oldest libraries in the world—Saint Catherine’s Monastery, Al-Qarawiyyin,
                    Nalanda University, the Vatican Library, or Sakya Monastery—are arguably the surviving nodes of a
                    network, as keepers of religious texts. They are made possible by the first principle of print—of
                    the codex and the scroll and even the manuscript—that it exists to be copied, to be multiple. This
                    in itself is an endorsement of the merits of decentralization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Globally, the performing arts, theater, dance, and music have all utilized decentralization as a
                    preservation tactic to a staggering level of success. In the case of European baroque and classical
                    music, thousands of orchestras and music schools across the world used and use the act of
                    collecting, copying, printing, studying, and playing to safeguard and transmit works across the
                    centuries. Even original instruments, now worth fortunes and hundreds of years old—the Stradivari,
                    Amati, Guarneri, Ruggieri, Guadagnini, et al—are still being played, preserved, passed down, and
                    held in trust for the next generation of players. Periods of war and upheaval have seen small groups
                    of musicians playing chamber music together in whatever spaces were available to them, allowing
                    musical works to conquer time.

                    Decentralized fan culture is inherently protective. Individual enthusiasts and digital pirates
                    gathering in forums and Discord channels have done an incredible job preserving literary, music,
                    video game, and film history through aggregation, emulation, and decentralized distribution.
                    High-quality versions of the original unaltered cuts of films like Star Wars (which are no longer
                    commercially available) are being preserved and held in this way. Volunteer

                    What is consistent about these examples is that they all involve groups who care. The most enduring
                    decentralized efforts don’t owe their success to technological or organizational innovation, but
                    rather by having enlisted generations of people with an emotional and intellectual investment in
                    their worth. For both cloud storage services and distributed storage schemes, the question is
                    whether they can provoke the necessary level of passion and watchfulness. Are they and their
                    technologies empowering those who care, or setting them up to fail? Can cloud storage corporations
                    transform themselves into wardens? Can distributed storage systems turn each node into a guardian?

                    I have mostly been beating around the bush here for 12,000 words. One can make a real argument that
                    storage methods and media are largely irrelevant to survival over such long periods. The success of
                    century-scale storage comes down to the same thing that storage and preservation of any duration
                    does: maintenance. The everyday work of a human being caring for something. If a collection enjoys
                    proper maintenance and care for 400 years, odds are, that collection will survive 400 years. How it
                    is stored will evolve or change as it is maintained, but if there are maintainers, it will persist.

                    This will stay true even with huge potential advancements in storage media on the horizon—<a

                    Digital storage relies on software. All software and file formats are dependent on upkeep and
                    preservation, as the march of technological advancement renders the hardware and software previously
                    used to read and create media obsolete. Longstanding software is rare enough that it can become an
                    object of fascination. In 2015,

                    The IRS’s Individual Master File, the primary system for storing and processing tax submissions and
                    inputting their data, was originally written in COBOL for IBM System/360 mainframe computers and has
                    been running since the 1960s. There are parts of the UNIX codebase that have been continuously in
                    use since the operating system’s start in 1969. There are likely implementations of assembly
                    language that have been going since the 1950s.

                    It’s hard to determine the oldest piece of continuous digitally stored data that is not software or
                    code itself and was never physicalized and re-digitized. Based on who the early adopters of hard
                    drive and tape storage systems were, I would hazard that it’s a piece of meteorological or
                    seismographic data recorded at a university on the West Coast of the United States, but that’s just
                    a guess. The fact that some of these datasets were also held in print archives and later reentered
                    into digital databases makes it hard to say for sure. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
                    Administration’s primary computer weather data system and Data Buoy systems have both been in use
                    since 1970. These datasets have persisted through vigilance and the grinding attention of
                    generations of scientists and their students. But none of them are close to attaining our 100-year
                    mark.

                    Our digital tools fall into obsolescence and disrepair at an astonishing pace. Totally aside from
                    issues related to preservation and storage, the risks when we fail to maintain software, and the
                    knowledge and capacity to maintain it, are real and exigent. During the COVID-19 pandemic, several
                    state and local governments found themselves in desperate need of COBOL programmers, as their
                    unemployment and insurance systems still ran on software built in the relatively ancient language.
                    If you want to store something for a hundred years, the ability to read and retrieve that stored
                    item in the future is critical. And the only way to ensure that ability is to preserve the software
                    that allows you to access your data, preserve the hardware that can run that software, and preserve
                    the knowledge and skills required to maintain the entire system."

                    file format is a standard for preserving web-based holdings that accommodates all sorts of secondary
                    content. Fedora is a digital resource management system built from the ground up to preserve digital
                    assets. CLOCKSS is an independent nonprofit implementation of LOCKSS technology intended as a
                    long-term dark archive for journals and books. Rhizome, a digital art and culture organization that
                    works out of the New Museum in New York City, has a dedicated digital preservation team working to
                    preserve digital works. ArchiveBox is a self-hosted solution to archiving the web. The Media

                    The real solution to century-scale storage, especially at scale, is to change this reality.
                    Successful century-scale storage will require a massive investment in digital preservation, a
                    societal commitment. Politicians, governments, companies, and investors will have to be convinced,
                    incentivized, or even bullied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The United States allocates scant resources to the practice and problem of archiving and
                    preservation in general. I tried to calculate what percentage of U.S. GDP is spent on libraries and
                    archives—not just digital preservation, not even just preservation, but what sort of resources were
                    allocated to the entire category. I aggregated budget reports from national, state, and local
                    agencies, nonprofit institutions, industry groups, and corporate archives; assessed the productive
                    capacities of the industries that serve these groups; spoke with economists, experts, and analysts
                    at UBS, Morgan Stanley, and the Congressional Budget Office—and was never able to get close to an
                    estimate that cracked 0.1 percent of GDP. According to the Institute of Museum and Library Services
                    (IMLS) Public Libraries Survey, public libraries in the United States had a total operating
                    expenditure of about $13 billion in FY 2018. The National Archives requested $481 million for their
                    2024 budget. The private sector spends very little on its own archival efforts. Even extremely large
                    companies tend to employ a single corporate archivist, if that. Relative to the size of any other
                    part of our government or economy, these numbers are tiny.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Software is running our world. Spending so little to attempt to preserve something so important is a
                    scandal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best option to ensure century-scale storage is to radically change this order. Any storage
                    provider serious about being a viable long-term storage option should be screaming about software
                    preservation at every opportunity. If the corporate stakeholders in this space are serious about
                    providing long-term storage to customers, they should wield the full power of their financial,
                    human, and political capital to make digital preservation a greater priority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every time a media company destroys an archive, every time a video game company prosecutes the
                    preservers of content it has abandoned, every time a tech company kills a well-used product with no
                    plan for preservation, these actions should be met with attention and resistance.

                    If you want to store something for 100 years, what are the best methods for ensuring its survival?
                    Hold it within a social or governmental structure that is most likely to facilitate maintenance and
                    care. Be under the protection of or affiliated with the right nation-state (for example, one could
                    argue that the holdings of the Library of Congress are backed up by the full force of the United
                    States nuclear arsenal). Be part of a major religion. Be part of an aristocracy. Be part of a
                    prominent artistic or intellectual scene, or a participant in an artistic or intellectual tradition.

                    Still, each of these governance structures also presents risks. “There is no political power without
                    power over the archive,” Jacques Derrida wrote in <em>Archive Fever</em>. The centralized power
                    structures of monarchies, despotic states, military dictatorships, and single-party rule all have a
                    penchant for the intentional destruction of artifacts and records in order to maintain control.
                    Clan-based systems regularly destroy that which is not contained within them. Dominant free-market
                    ideologies actively incentivize the mass abandonment of anything that does not have the market value
                    to sustain itself. Nation-states, even social democracies that rank highly on various freedom
                    indices, have a spectacular capacity for both conscious and accidental censorship, selective
                    preservation, and desertion of the artifacts under their care. As Fernando Báez writes in

                    “It’s a common error to attribute the destruction of books to
                    ignorant men unaware of their hatred. After twelve years of study, I’ve concluded that the more
                    cultured a nation or a person is, the more willing each is to eliminate books under the pressure of
                    apocalyptic myths.”

                    In order to survive, a data storer, and the makers of the tools they use, must be prepared to adopt
                    a skeptical and even defiant attitude toward the societies in which they live. They must accept the
                    protection of a patron while also preparing for the possibility of betrayal. If you’re wondering why
                    much of this essay takes such an antagonistic pose toward external political and economic actors,
                    while also considering the fruits of their offerings, it is because the century-scale archivist must
                    sometimes be in service of an ideology that only answers to itself—to the protection of the
                    collected artifacts at all costs. This ideology, an “Archivism,” entails a belief in the
                    preservation of that which we make and think for future generations, at the expense of anything
                    else. Century-scale storage can span methods and platforms, be enabled by governments and titans of
                    industry, be helped by religions, cultures, artists, scenes, fans, collectors, technocrats, and
                    engineers, but it must, at the end of the day, retain its values internally.

                    This is where, once again, the only true solution is an aggressive and massive investment in
                    archives, libraries, digital preservationists, and software and hardware maintainers at every level,
                    in every form of practice and economic circumstance. This needs to happen not just for states,
                    corporations, and institutions, but for hobbyists and consumers. Many of our most treasured artistic
                    and intellectual artifacts survived for decades in the hands of individuals long before they entered
                    institutional care.

                    Resilience over time is not something that can be designed at the moment of inception and then
                    forgotten. Century-scale storage requires a watchful eye that can adapt to new threats, to new
                    paradigms, to that which could not be previously imagined. The goal of century-scale storage must be
                    to preserve that which we have created so that others, those we will never meet, may experience
                    their intricacies and ecstasies, their capacities for enlightenment. This should be done by whatever
                    means necessary, whatever method or decision ensures the possibility of that future—one day at a
                    time,—and be willing to change at any moment, to scrap and claw against the forces attempting to
                    smother the light.

                    If you are a company that offers a storage product, how can you help the long-term digital storage
                    of archival material? Try to find a new investment model, one which might allow you to build for the
                    longer term. Embrace open protocols. Support Right To Repair laws and build hardware that is
                    repairable. Attack firms on other parts of the network and computational chains bent on
                    centralization and monopoly. Help fund and implement a completely new paradigm of the digital
                    preservation of software.

                    And if you, an individual reading this, want to store something and ensure it survives a century,
                    what should you do? More than one thing. You should combine every method available to you, layers of
                    backups, armies of copies, and most of all, practices and sites that encourage a culture of
                    watchfulness and care. You should fight for a society that values the sciences and arts and that
                    which they produce. And then, each day, you should do whatever it takes to keep your something safe,
                    do whatever you can to empower the next generation to do the same, and then entrust that battle to
                    them, to repeat into futurity.

                    In 2009, a couple renovated an abandoned house in sleepy St. Anne, Illinois. The house was in bad
                    shape, clearly vandalized, ransacked, cracking and warping. They found papers strewn and stacked all
                    over, with the name “Florence Price” written on them again and again. They had unwittingly
                    discovered the composer’s former vacation house 56 years after her death, and a dozen works that had
                    been thought long-lost, including two violin concertos and her fourth symphony. In 2015, the editor
                    of a literary magazine was trolling through Princeton University’s rare book archive when he came
                    across an unreleased short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, which had been intended for publication but
                    never released because of a conflict between the author and his agent. An unpublished Edith Wharton
                    story was found at Yale’s Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library that same year. In 2010, at that
                    same archive, Richard Wright’s daughter found a previously unpublished novel manuscript hidden
                    within his papers. If you walked into a record store in the early 1950s and asked them for a copy of
                    Vivaldi’s “Four Seasons,” now one of the most ubiquitous pieces of music in the world, chances are
                    they would have had no idea what you were talking about. In the 1920s, a small group of Vivaldi
                    enthusiasts in Italy scoured local libraries and repositories for what was then thought of as a
                    minor figure’s works, eventually finding half his scores in a monastery in Piedmont, and the other
                    half held by a wealthy aristocratic family. The group found financial backers, purchased both
                    collections for the University of Turin, and went to work for the next three decades resurrecting a
                    musical reputation. By the 1960s, Vivaldi was omnipresent. When the Czech National Museum was
                    re-cataloging and digitizing their archives in 2015, they found a long-lost 1785 collaboration
                    between Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. Just this year, the municipal libraries of
                    Leipzig revealed that another Mozart composition had been rediscovered within their holdings. A few
                    weeks before this piece was published, the <em>New York Times</em> revealed a curator at the Morgan
                    Library &amp; Museum had unearthed

                    All of these works were republished, rerecorded, or re-performed to great acclaim. What was lost was
                    found. Small individual acts of care, spread over generations, led to their survival and
                    rediscovery. The digital versions of these miracles can and will happen. One day, someone will find
                    the flash drive on the ransacked floor of a house, the forgotten server in the ruin of a data
                    center, the file in the bowel of a database. It will matter. Even if their contents had been damaged
                    or forgotten, actions of previous care can bear fruit decades later. They are the difference between
                    recovery and despair.
